# Credit-Scoring-Model

This repository contains a project focused on predicting the default for the next month. The project includes a machine learning model, a Python script used to train the model, and a Streamlit app for user interaction.
## Files in the Repository

1. **`model.pkl`**:
   - Contains the trained classification model for predicting credit payment defaults based on customer data.

2. **`credit_app(1).py`**:
   - This script is responsible for data preprocessing, training the classification model, and saving it to `model.pkl`.

3. **`streamlit_app.py`**:
   - This file contains the Streamlit web app that allows users to input customer data and receive predictions on whether they will default on the next month's payment.
